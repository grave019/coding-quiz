### 1. Introduction

The goal of this project was to simulate a coding assessment quiz. Often, assessments test the knowledge of potential applicants. For my quiz I chose a 10 multiple question test focussing on JavaScript.

### 2. Goals

My goal when making this test was to ask questions that the typical coder should know. In order to make this test, I created index.html page to house the questions on the test. I also created a highscore.html page to score the high scores on local storage within the website. I chose to border the questions and answers in a crimson and white color scheme that was appealing to me. When creating my logic.js page I first created an array of 10 questions that I will be pulling my questions from. In the quiz I have given the test taker 10 seconds per question for a total of 100 seconds. If a question is answered incorrectly a penalty of 10 seconds will be deducted from the test takers time alotment. In order to display these questions sequentially and have a web page that changes with every answer I used jquery queryselector to connect in the document with the id tags in the html document.
I was able to accomplish each of these goals. The user is able to input their initials after they take the quiz and then they are taken to the highscore.html page.

### 3. Reflection

As a junior web developer I found this task to be extremely challenging. I learned a great deal due to white boarding this solution and came up with many different ways I could have approached this task. I would like to revisit this quiz format in the future to create a longer test or add some extra trivia to help me prepare for the interview process. This project has helped me hone my skills and allowed me to become more familiar with JavaScript. It is a very difficult language but I am starting to get a handle on it. In addition, to the 10 JavaScript questions I asked, I decided to add 10 questions pertaining to the MCU just for fun. I hope you had just as much fun taking this quiz as I did making it.
